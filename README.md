# Technical Track of Computer Tools for Linguistic Research (2021/2022)

As a part of a compulsory course 
[Computer Tools for Linguistic Research](https://www.hse.ru/en/edu/courses/494759476)
in [National Research University Higher School of Economics](https://www.hse.ru/).

This technical track is aimed at building basic skills for retrieving data from external
WWW resources and processing it for future linguistic research. The idea is to automatically 
obtain a dataset that has a certain structure and appropriate content, 
perform morphological analysis using various natural language processing (NLP) 
libraries. [Dataset requirements](./docs/dataset.md).

Instructors: 

* [Khomenko Anna Yurievna](https://www.hse.ru/org/persons/65858472) - linguistic track lecturer
* [Lyashevskaya Olga Nikolaevna](https://www.hse.ru/staff/olesar) - linguistic track lecturer
* [Demidovskij Alexander Vladimirovich](https://www.hse.ru/staff/demidovs#sci) - technical track lecturer
* [Uraev Dmitry Yurievich](https://www.hse.ru/org/persons/208529395) - technical track practice lecturer

Software solution is built on top of three components:
1. [`scrapper.py`](./scrapper.py) - a module for finding articles from the given media, extracting text and
   dumping it to the file system. Students need to implement it.
1. [`pipeline.py`](./pipeline.py) - a module for processing text: point-of-speech tagging and 
   basic morphological analysis. Students need to implement it.
1. [`article.py`](core_utils/article.py) - a module for article abstraction to encapsulate low-level
   manipulations with the article
   
## Handing over your work

Order of handing over:

1. lab work is accepted for oral presentation.
2. a student has explained the work of the program and showed it in action.
3. a student has completed the min-task from a mentor that requires some slight code modifications.
4. a student receives a mark:
   1. that corresponds to the expected one, if all the steps above are completed and mentor is satisfied with 
      the answer;
   2. one point bigger than the expected one, if all the steps above are completed and mentor is very 
      satisfied with the answer;
   3. one point smaller than the expected one, if a lab is handed over one week later than the deadline and 
      criteria from 4.1 are satisfied;
   4. two points smaller than the expected one, if a lab is handed over more than one week later than 
      the deadline and criteria from 4.1 are satisfied.

> NOTE: a student might improve their mark for the lab, if they complete tasks of the next level after handing over
> the lab.

A lab work is accepted for oral presentation if all the criteria below are satisfied:

1. there is a Pull Request (PR) with a correctly formatted name:
   `Laboratory work #<NUMBER>, <SURNAME> <NAME> - <UNIVERSITY GROUP NAME>`. Example: `Laboratory work #1, Kuznetsova Valeriya - 19FPL1`.
2. has a filled file `target_score.txt` with an expected mark. Acceptable values: 4, 6, 8, 10.
3. has green status.
4. has a label `done`, set by mentor.
